## About EST Base

A few years ago, Clan Base was the largest communities in which to make matches or encounters with teams from arround the world and any game. As a professional ex-gamer, and as a developer, I have the concern no see reborn a project like this.

This is EST Base, a place to compete, get experience, qualify, win, ... That serves as historical for the teams, with their achievements, their statistics, their personal page, ...
An ambitious project, in which I hope the gamer community gets involved.
